## Intro
This homework contains two files for problem 1 and problem 8. prob1.py conations three numerical methods for solving multidimensional SDEs.
## The high level idea is to creat a 3-dim vector and iterate through Xk. Enventually, the 3-d graph of three component is plotted.
## The first method is Euler Mruyama Method. Here, we take ks as the binomial distribution and return plus/minus 1 with equal probability. The funciton inputs are the final time T and number of grids n. 

## The second method is according to scheme 2 with independent ks described in the method. 

## The third method is Runge Kutta. Since we set sigma = 1, the first derivation of sigma vanished.
