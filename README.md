## Intro
This homework contains two files for problem 1 and problem 8. prob1.py conations three numerical methods for solving multidimensional SDEs. The high level idea is to creat a 3-dim vector and iterate through Xk. Enventually, the 3-d graph of three component is plotted.

## Euler Maruyama
The first method is Euler Mruyama Method. Here, we take ks as the binomial distribution and return plus/minus 1 with equal probability. The funciton inputs are the final time T and number of grids n. 

## Scheme 2
The second method is according to scheme 2 with independent ks described in the method. 

## Runge Kutta
The third method is Runge Kutta. Since we set sigma = 1, the first derivation of sigma vanished. 

## p8
p8.py contains the code foe problem 8. This partis inspired by Bill and An. The main part of this problem is running out of time.
